# Intrusion_Detection_System
Intrusion is when an attacker gets unauthorized access to a device, network, or system. Cyber criminals use advanced techniques to sneak into organizations without being detected.  Intrusion Detection System (IDS) observes network traffic for malicious transactions and sends immediate alerts when it is observed. It is software that checks a network or system for malicious activities or policy violations.

SNORT is a powerful open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS) that provides real-time network traffic analysis and data packet logging. SNORT uses a rule-based language that combines anomaly, protocol, and signature inspection methods to detect potentially malicious activity.
